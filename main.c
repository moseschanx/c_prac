// Section 18 Challenge  
/*

  #1
    test your understanding of random numbers

    Write a C program taht generate 50 ramdom numbers between -0.5 and 0.5

    Out put the random numbers
      the first line of output should be the number of data 
      the next 50 lines should be the 50 random numbers

    You're required to use the srand function , passing in the time function 
      as a seed to using the rand() function.

  #2
    test your understanding of the quick sort algorithm ( qsort() ) from the stdlib.h file

    Write a program that will sort an array of doubles from lowest to highest using the qsort function 
    Create a function that takes a double array and a size parameter which generates some random double values

      void fillarray(double ar[],int n);

    Create a function that takes a double array and a size parameter which generates some random double values
      void showarray(const double ar[] , int n);

    Your main function should 
      Create an array 
      fill it with random numbers
      display it 
      sort it using qsort 
      display the sorted array

  #3
    test your understanding of getting the current time 

      Write a program to print the current time
      You should see the time and ctime functions
      You should handle errors using fprintf and the exit function with the correct failure code 

  #4

    test your understanding of using the tm structure 

    Write a program to compute the number of seconds passed since the beginning of the current month
      You should use the localtime , difftime , and mktime functions
      You should handlel errors using fprintf and the exit function with the correct failure codes

/*

  #1 Linked List 
    test your understanding of linked list 
    
  Write a program that performs operations on a linked list 

  You need to create a linked list that stores integers and uses pointers

  Your program should perform the following operations 
    Inseret node at first
    Insert node at first
    Insert node at position 
    Delete node from any position 
    Update node value 
    Search Element in the linked list 
    Display list
    Exit

  Your program should create a strructure that stores each nodes value and contains a next pointer

  Your program can utilize global variables for previous , head, tail , temp , new nodes, etc 
  or you can pass around data to function
